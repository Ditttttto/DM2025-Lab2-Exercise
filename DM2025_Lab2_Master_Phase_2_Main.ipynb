This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",

To give you the best suggestions, let's figure out what kind of mood you're in.\n\nPick the category that sounds most appealing to you for tomorrow night:\n\n---\n\n### **Category 1: Quick & Easy (Under 30 Minutes)**\nYou'll be tired, busy, or just don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.\n\n*   **Sheet Pan Lemon Herb Chicken with Veggies:** Toss chicken pieces (thighs or breast) and your favorite veggies (broccoli, bell peppers, red onion) with olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, and garlic powder. Spread on a baking sheet and roast at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes. Minimal cleanup, maximum flavor.\n*   **Creamy Tomato Soup & Fancy Grilled Cheese:** A classic for a reason. Use a good quality canned or boxed tomato soup and elevate it with a splash of cream or coconut milk. For the grilled cheese, use a nice bread (like sourdough) and a good melting cheese (like Gruyère or sharp cheddar) with a thin layer of mayo on the outside for a perfect golden crust.\n*   **Speedy Black Bean Tacos:** Sauté a can of black beans with some onion, garlic, and taco seasoning. Warm up some tortillas and serve with your favorite toppings like avocado, salsa, shredded lettuce, and a sprinkle of cheese or a dollop of sour cream.\n\n---\n\n### **Category 2: Healthy & Light**\nYou want something nutritious that won't weigh you down.\n\n*   **Salmon with Roasted Asparagus and Quinoa:** A perfectly balanced meal. Season a salmon filet with salt, pepper, and dill. Roast it alongside some asparagus spears tossed in olive oil. Serve with a side of fluffy quinoa.\n*   **Big Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken (or Chickpeas):** Super fresh and satisfying. Chop up romaine lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, and Kalamata olives. Top with grilled chicken strips or a can of chickpeas for a vegetarian option. Drizzle with a simple lemon-oregano vinaigrette and top with feta cheese.\n*   **Turkey or Veggie Burgers in Lettuce Wraps:** A great low-carb, high-protein option. Cook your favorite turkey or plant-based burger patty and serve it wrapped in a large, crisp lettuce leaf (like iceberg or butter lettuce) instead of a bun. Top with all the usual suspects: tomato, onion, and pickles.\n\n---\n\n### **Category 3: Comforting & Cozy**\nYou want a meal that feels like a warm hug.\n\n*   **One-Pot Creamy Chicken and Mushroom Pasta:** Sauté chicken and mushrooms, then add garlic, broth, and cream. Let it simmer before adding uncooked pasta right into the pot to cook in the sauce. It's rich, satisfying, and saves you from washing extra dishes.\n*   **Simple Shepherd's Pie:** A savory ground meat (beef, lamb, or lentils for a veggie version) and vegetable filling cooked in a rich gravy, topped with a fluffy layer of mashed potatoes and baked until golden brown. Pure comfort.\n*   **Hearty Lentil Stew:** A fantastic and affordable vegetarian option. Sauté carrots, celery, and onion, then add lentils, vegetable broth, and herbs like thyme and bay leaf. Let it simmer until the lentils are tender. It's incredibly filling and nutritious.\n\n---\n\n### **To help me narrow it down even more, tell me:**\n\n*   How much time do you *really* want to spend cooking?\n*   What kind of ingredients do you already have? (Any protein or veggies you need to use up?)\n*   Are you craving anything specific (spicy, cheesy, fresh, etc.)?\n\nLet me know what sounds good, and I can even help you find a specific recipe"

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

        "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

        "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
        "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
        "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
        "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
